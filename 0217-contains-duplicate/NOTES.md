​​​Intuition
=========
- Compare values in the array to check if same
- Iterate over the elements in the array

Approach
=========
- Refer to comments in solution code

Complexity
==========

-   Time complexity:
O(n^2) - Quadratic <br>
Inefficient method. Can be optimized to O(n) - Linear, using new Set() and comparing length of Set and nums array.

-   Space complexity:
O(1) - Constant
